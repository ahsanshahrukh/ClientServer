People who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do
Failure will never overtake me if my determination to succeed is strong enough
We may encounter many defeats but we must not be defeated
Knowing is not enough; we must apply. Wishing is not enough; we must do
Imagine your life is perfect in every respect; what would it look like
The man who has confidence in himself gains the confidence of others
People who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do
Failure will never overtake me if my determination to succeed is strong enough
We may encounter many defeats but we must not be defeated
Knowing is not enough; we must apply. Wishing is not enough; we must do
Imagine your life is perfect in every respect; what would it look like
The man who has confidence in himself gains the confidence of others
